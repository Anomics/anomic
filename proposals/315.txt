Amend Rule 201 to the following:
Players can play at any time. A time can be set by a rule for "end-of-round", hereby called "EOR". Any player's turn that hasn't completed all the parts (by the definition of rule 310 or any rule that succeeds it) before the EOR is deemed to be incomplete, and any and all proposals made on such a turn by that player will be deemed to be automatically rejected. Any rules passed before the EOR will go into effect only after the EOR. In the event that EOR has not been defined by any rule, the default EOR is 48 hrs since the previous EOR. The first EOR will be 00:00 GMT following the passing of this rule.

Per-part end times, similar to the EOR may be defined by other rules. However, in no event shall any per-part end time be greater than the EOR as defined by rules at that time. All per-turn end times must complete before the EOR is reached.

All players begin with zero points.
