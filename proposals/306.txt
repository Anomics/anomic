Players can make multiple proposals in a turn, which will follow the same numbering as if they had been proposed individually, and voting will happen on the proposals that a quorum of the players agree to bring to vote, and the other proposals will be automatically rejected. The initial quorum will be simple majority. Rejected proposals do not
carry over between turns, they have to be reintroduced. All of the proposals a player makes in a turn must be submitted all at once, with the judgement of what ‘all at once’ means left up to the Judge, if brought to question by any player besides the Judge, unless there are are only two players, in which case the Judge can simply make the decision.
